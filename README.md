This project is part of the [Data and Analytics (Data Analyst) Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).

Data was provided from [Udacity](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/July/5b57919a_data-set-options/data-set-options.pdf). The FBI Gun Permit data was provided from a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks/blob/master/README.md) and the census data is sourced from the [US Census Bureau](cecensus.gov).

The data was gathered and cleaned using Python prior to analysis. Then the data was analyzed and visualized using Matplotlib to answer three chosen research questions. Finally, conclusions were drawn from the analysis.

Packages used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.

Languages used: Python via Jupyter Notebook.
